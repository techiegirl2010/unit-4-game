// When you click on a crystal, you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

// Crystal values are between 1 and 12.

// Goal of game (WIN) by matching your total score to the random number.

// When win, you see a "You won!" and your win score increases by one.

// You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

// When lose, you see a "You lost!" and your loss score increases by one.

//The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.

// Each time you click a crystal, it adds to your score until you match or go over the computer's random number.

// Game restarts when there is a win or a loss.

// Each time game restarts, the computer generates a new random number that you see.

// Each time the game restarts, your score will reset to 0.

// Each time the game restarts, the game will change the value for each crystal.

// The randomly generated number on each crystal is between 1 and 12.

// The randomly generated number the computer generates is between 19 and 120.
